# About project
Read-adviser-bot - the bot reads the links that are given to it, saves it and advises a random link from the saved ones.

It can be useful for people who often save many links, but always forget about them.

As storage used SQLite3, also you can use filesystem as storage

# Quick start

$go run main.go -tg-token="your_telegram-_bot_token"
